    <P>Telangana Assembly Election Results 2023 updates | Congress swearing-in ceremony likely on December 4 or 9</P>
    <hr/>
    <pre>Congress emerged victorious in 64 among the total 119 seats. BRS managed to secure 39 seats as the Telangana 
        Assembly election results came out on December 3.

        Incumbent Anjani Kumar was suspended by ECI after he met TPCC chief at his residence even as counting of votes 
        was on and Election Code of Conduct was in force.

        The BJP was initially considered the main Opposition to BRS, but the scenario changed after the Congress gained 
        momentum following the Karnataka elections in May. Several exit polls predicted a Congress victory, removing 
        the ruling BRS from power for the first time since the formation of the State in 2014.
